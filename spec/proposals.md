# Proposals

Ideas that are in no language version yet. Each one says its version
impact (see `VERSIONING.md`):

- **additive**: it can go into the next minor language version
- **breaking**: it waits for the next major language version

Until the first release, any proposal can go straight into 1.0 (see
"Before the first release" in `VERSIONING.md`).

## Two events with the same transition (Postponed)

Version impact: additive.

    g, h :: Y -> Z  -- two events "g" and "h" with the same transition

## `<-` is a shorthand, `a' <-` means `a -> a'`

Version impact: additive.

It builds on `=>`, which is in v1 (see "Shared path" in `spec-v1.md`):

    X => Y => A' * B' <-

Means:

    X(Y(A' * B')) <-

## `@` annotation

Version impact: additive.

An annotation is metadata: something the application needs that the
types can't say (how a value is drawn, when a transition is unavailable,
which side effect a transition causes). SumSpec gives it no meaning; the
target (the code generator) does.

An annotation is `@name` followed by its arguments, which the checker
treats as opaque. Available annotations are declared once, in a header
block like `__events`; only declared names may be used. A comment next to
each name documents it:

    __annotations {
      @control     -- what widget edits a value or triggers an action
      @unless      -- a transition is unavailable while this state holds
      @effect      -- a side effect the transition causes
    }

An annotation goes after the head of a type definition, after the
variant or member it belongs to, or on the lines after a transition.
Several may be stacked:

    Draft @default Empty = Empty | Typing Text @control text_field

    exportLogs :: Page.Logs -> Page.Logs
      @control button_icon
      @effect share Logs

In a newtype `A = B @x`, the annotation belongs to `A`; in a sum or a
product it belongs to the variant or member it follows.

SumSpec has no event outputs (see `efsm-gaps.md`, section 4): a side
effect is an annotation on the transition, such as `@effect`.

The checker verifies that every name is declared in `__annotations` and
declared once. Checking arguments is open: opaque tokens first, then
arguments that are state paths (`@unless`, `@when`) read as patterns.

A type the notation does not decompose is declared inside __atomics. An
atomic has no members here; each target supplies it.

## Dependent type

Version impact: additive.

    BoundedList = { xs : [Int] // 2 <= xs.len /\ xs.len <= 10 }

## Generic type

Version impact: additive.

    List a = [a]

## Variant refinement

Version impact: additive.

    PMode.ShowMission = List | Selected Mission

A variant declared without a payload gets its payload from a separate
definition, addressed by its path. Today the payload is written inline:

    PMode
      = ...
      | ShowMission (List (...) | Selected Mission)

## Naming an element

Version impact: additive.

    rename TodoId#id :: Todos[id]#t -> ...

`L[x]#t` names the element, with the element type (`Todo`), not the
list type. Not allowed yet.
